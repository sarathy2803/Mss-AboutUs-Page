                    <p>In the city of Madras, there have been many affluent couples. However, only a few of them have
                        truly considered the plight of those who struggle to survive and have actively helped improve
                        their
                        lives.Among these few couples were Sir Mutha and Lady Andal Venkatasubba Rao, who dedicated
                        their lives to uplift and empower the lives of distressed children and young women.</p>
                    <p>In 1928, faced with the departure of Mrs. Margaret Cousins from India, Mr. Deodhar of the Poona
                        Seva Sadan
                        Society took charge of the Women's Home of Service (who’s Honorary General Secretary was Lady
                        Andal), with an
                        initial donation of Rs. 750. As Mr. Deodhar was disinclined to incur further expenses, Sir
                        Mutha,made a donation of Rs.10,000, thus establishing The Madras Seva Sadan.</p>
                    <p>By establishing The Madras Seva Sadan, Sir Mutha & Lady Andal became leading agents of social
                        change in the
                        City. Over the next four decades of their fruitful lives, they made substantial contributions to
                        education,
                        social welfare and reform in the Indian society. This continues till today, through The Madras
                        Seva Sadan.</p>
                    <p>With a rich history spanning over 90 years, the many institutions under The Madras Seva Sadan
                        have thrived.Today, The Madras Seva Sadan stands as one of the most revered institutions in
                        Chennai,celebrated for its inclusive social and cultural values. It remains unwavering in its
                        commitment to shaping accomplished individuals with well-rounded personalities through
                        education, sports, social causes and arts.

                                        After a brilliant academic career, he educated from Madras Christian College. On
                                        securing his B.L. Degree, he became apprenticed to Sir C.V. Kumaraswamy Sastri.
                                        He was enrolled as a Vakil in July 1903. In July 1904, he formed a partnership
                                        with Mr. Radhakrishnaya, his collegemate and they practiced under the name of
                                        Venkatasubba Rao and Radhakrishnaya.</p>

                                    <p class="p10-Style mt-4">In the space of few years, Sir Mutha Venkatasubba Rao
                                        became
                                        one of the leaders of the Bar. His forte was on the Original Side.</p>
                                    <p class="p10-Style mt-3">He was appointed Judge of the Madras High Court in 1921.
                                        This
                                        appointment was unique in two ways. Sir Venkatasubba Rao was the first
                                        practitioner on the Original Side to be appointed as a Judge. Secondly, he was
                                        the youngest person to sit on the bench of the Madras High Court. </p>

                                    <p class="p10-Style mt-3">In the year 1922, he married Andalamma. This marriage was
                                        a
                                        milestone in his life. Together with Andalamma, he was able to implement his
                                        passion for social welfare and reform, in founding The Madras Seva Sadan.

                                    <p class="p10-Style mt-3">After serving as a Judge for about 17 years, he retired in
                                        1939
                                        as the acting Chief Justice of the Madras High Court. He will always be
                                        remembered first and foremost as one of the greatest Judges of the Madras High
                                        Court.</p>
                                    <p class="p10-Style mt-3">In 1939, he was appointed as the Agent for Berar of the
                                        Nizam
                                        of Hyderabad. This choice fell on him and it was given to him as the first agent
                                        to lay the foundation, to devise the pattern and set the tradition of the high
                                        and unique office which had no precedence to fall back on.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="p10-Style mt-3">Sir Mutha Venkatasubba Rao’s judicial career was marked by
                                        his
                                        passion for justice, complete independence of outlook and adherence to the truth
                                        as he saw it. He had an iron will and never accepted conformity or ready
                                        acquiescence as a principle of action. As a result, his long judicial career was
                                        one of the most successful and eventful in Madras Legal History.</p>

                                        which
                                        he carried into his everyday life. He hated shoddiness and disorder. He was
                                        scrupulously particular about dress and food. Cleanliness was to him a part of
                                        Godliness. Then again, in his public activities, he was equally thorough. He
                                        could not tolerate anything slipshod, anything vague and equivocal or anything
                                        which was underhand. He was always kind and courteous. He was a great
                                        philanthropist, giving away a great part of his wealth for social causes, in
                                        particular to The Madras Seva Sadan.</p>

                                        <p class="p10-Style">One hundred years ago, Madras was, as you can imagine, a
                                            very different place, where huge, shady trees formed lovely avenues, very
                                            few vehicles were seen on the road, and people led gracious, simple lives.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="p10-Style">It was, in other ways, not an idyllic place. There were
                                            many injustices in those days, especially against women, who were not
                                            treated well at all.</p>
                                        <img src="./Assets/lady_with_cusin.png" class="mob8-Style" alt="lady-andal">
                                        <p class="p10-Style mt-3">It was into that world that our founder, Andalamma,
                                            was born in the year 1894. Since she came from a well-to-do family, she had
                                            the benefit of good education (not many girls did, in those days). She went
                                            to St. Thomas Convent, Mylapore and the Presidency High School, Egmore. It
                                            was at these institutions that Andalamma learnt all the crafts and skills of
                                            a young lady of her time. Andalamma, as she grew up, was also learning
                                            something else that no school taught, but everyone needed. That special
                                            'something' was Social Awareness - the ability to feel compassion for the
                                            poor, helpless and less fortunate and the desire to someday do something to
                                            change their plight.</p>
                                        <img src="./Assets/lady_andal_youngwomen.png"
                                            class="mob8-Style lady_andal_Style" alt="lady_andal_youngwomen">
                                        <p class="p10-Style mt-3">Little did she realize how her opportunity would come.
                                            At a very young age, Andalamma became a widow and thought she must now
                                            accept a life of seclusion - for widows in those days could not remarry or
                                            mingle in society.</p>
                                        <p class="p10-Style mt-3">It was then that she met the person who would change
                                            her life, the Hon'ble Justice M. Venkatasubba Rao, a brilliant and much
                                            respected judge who was determined to make Andalamma his wife - a brave
                                            gesture in those times! Justice Venkatasubba Rao was a very special man -
                                            learned, courageous and upright in his beliefs. He deeply wished to
                                            transform the ills of society and in his young wife he found the ideal
                                            partner.</p>
                                        <img src="./Assets/la_mutha_marriage_mode.png" class="mob8-Style"
                                            alt="la_mutha_marriage_mode">
                                        <p class="p10-Style mt-3">Together, they set out to brighten the lives of
                                            hundreds of under-privileged people. The two of them believed in living by
                                            example - never to preach, but to practice their ideals and to show others
                                            by lighting the way.</p>
                                        <p class="p10-Style">This is exactly what they did. In 1928, with their own
                                            money (a grand sum of Rs. 10,000 which at that time was a generous figure
                                            indeed), they founded The Madras Seva Sadan - an institute to protect, teach
                                            and help destitute women and children and people who had been abandoned and
                                            mistreated by society.</p>
                                        <p class="p10-Style">Here, on the sprawling grounds of this noble institution,
                                            all the ideals and love in the mind and heart of Lady Andal began to take
                                            shape. At The Madras Seva Sadan, women who thought they had nothing to live
                                            for found new purpose and meaning in life. They were fed and clothed, given
                                            work, taught skills and encouraged to become happy, independent members of
                                            society. Their numbers grew from 8 to 3,000 in just 30 years.</p>
                                        <img src="./Assets/ladyandal_early_batch_student.png"
                                            class="mob8-Style lady_andal_Style" alt="lady_andal_Style">
                                        <p class="p10-Style">The Madras Seva Sadan and all the many other institutions
                                            under it, grew from strength to strength under Lady Andal's firm and careful
                                            guidance. She was not just a leader of people, but also took a personal
                                            interest in each one. Her stately presence was beloved by all.</p>
                                        <p class="p10-Style mt-3">Dressed in beautiful silk sarees she would weave
                                            flowers into the hair of little girls, feed them personally with rice balls,
                                            take them for evening drives to the beach. (She was one of the first ladies
                                            to drive her own car in those old-fashioned times). When the holidays came
                                            and some children had no home to go to, she took them to her own beautiful
                                            house where they spent memorable times together.</p>
                                        <p class="p10-Style mt-3">In fact, she was truly a mother to many, taking care
                                            of them until they were old enough to marry, finding good husbands for the
                                            girls, and organizing the weddings, for which she herself would buy the
                                            sarees and jewellery.</p>
                                        <p class="p10-Style mt-3">Lady Andal worked tirelessly to organize the many
                                            activities and functions of The Madras Seva Sadan. Breaking all barriers of
                                            caste, creed, religion and social stigma, The Madras Seva Sadan took in
                                            people from any and every background. In fact, once a Harijan girl joined
                                            the school, but the upper caste children did not want to eat with her. Lady
                                            Andal did not scold or lecture, but taught the children a lesson they would
                                            never forget. She invited all the children to eat with her. At the meal, she
                                            seated the Harijan child on her right, with the other children all around
                                            them and then she began to eat. Once the others saw this, they realized how
                                            small and limited their thinking was. The problem never came up again.</p>

                                        <p class="p10-Style mt-3">This was how Lady Andal, like a bright star, lit the
                                            way for others, dispelling the darkness of ignorance and prejudice. Yes, for
                                            all her greatness, she was a humble lady. She was honoured with very
                                            prestigious awards – the King George's Medal, the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal and
                                            the Padma Bhushan –for her outstanding work in social welfare, but these
                                            honours did not change her nor did any of her work ever come in the way of
                                            her being a loving and devoted wife. She stood by her husband during all his
                                            important postings.</p>

                                            as also the humblest. No one could ever doubt their welcome in her home. She
                                            always had time to celebrate birthdays and festivals with the family and
                                            filled their lives with joyful moments, beautiful gifts and fun-filled

                                            was as if the light had gone out of Lady Andal's life. Deeply grieved, she
                                            bore her loss with courage and still carried on her duties with a smile and

                                    <p class="mt-3 p10-Style">The late Correspondent, Mr. N. V. Rao, was born on 16th
                                        May 1925, in a well-known family of the Vaishya Community in Madras. After the
                                        early loss of his own parents, he was brought up by his paternal aunt, who was
                                        herself childless.</p>
                                    <p class="mt-3 p10-Style">In the Home of Lady Andal and Sir Mutha Venkatasubba Rao,
                                        he had the benefits of their wonderful tutelage and guidance. He lived,
                                        travelled, and learnt from them, the ways of the elite Indian people involved in
                                        the field of Law, Social Welfare and Education. The Emerging Heroes of the
                                        freedom movement were frequent visitors to his home as well as The Madras Seva
                                        Sadan, Mother institution of Sir Mutha Venkatasubba Rao School. It is not
                                        surprising that he, with the help of his wife Mrs. Seetha Rao, later founded the
                                        Sir Mutha Venkatasubba Rao School in memory of the Founder of The Madras Seva
                                        Sadan, Sir Mutha Venkatasubba Rao.</p>
                                    <img src="./Assets/nv_rao_yougn.png" alt="Rao">
                                    <p class="mt-4 p10-Style">After his schooling in the Good Shepherd Convent Madras,
                                        Mr. Rao went on to graduate with honours from Madras Loyola College with a B. A.
                                        Degree. He then went to England, where he obtained a degree in teaching.</p>
                                    <p class="mt-3 p10-Style">He later joined the Madras Law College and obtained his
                                        B.L. degree. He practiced as lawyer and served in the Public Prosecutor’s Office
                                        in the High Court of Madras.</p>
                                    <p class="mt-3 p10-Style">Mr. N. V. Rao was a great lover of Arts, Music and
                                        particularly Sports. He played cricket for the Loyola College Madras, as well as
                                        Tennis and other sports, in all of which he attained a degree of proficiency. On
                                        getting older, he became a knee golfer, and won many trophies in that sport. His
                                        love for sports is even now evident in the training that he had insisted on
                                        imparting to the students of the school in spite of the limited play field.</p>
                                    <p class="mt-3 p10-Style">He, like his forebearers, was involved in several welfare,
                                        sports organisations and clubs such as,The Madras Seva Sadan, Rotary Club, Lions
                                        Club, the Freemasons, the Madras Gymkhana Club and The Madras Cricket Club.</p>
                                    <p class="mt-3 p10-Style">He along with Mrs. N. Seetha Rao started the Sir Mutha
                                        Venkatasubba Rao School in June 1971, to commemorate the memory of the founder
                                        of The Madras Seva Sadan, the Late Justice, Sir Mutha Venkatasubba Rao. From the
                                        day the decision was taken to open the school, until his death, Mr. Rao was
                                        actively involved with Sir Mutha Venkatasubba Rao School. He built it up from
                                        its humble beginning with the hand full of students and semipucca class rooms,
                                        to the present prestigious and popular status it enjoys, in its pucca multi
                                        storied buildings.</p>
                                    <img src="./Assets/NVRao_speech.png" class="nv_rao_Style" alt="nv_rao_Style">
                                    <p class="mt-4 p10-Style">For a short period of time, he even tried his hand at
                                        teaching and enjoyed the same. However, administrative duties and health issues,
                                        did not allow him to continue as the teacher for long.</p>
                                    <p class="mt-4 p10-Style">These few lines hardly justify a commitment for a period
                                        of 21 years to the school. But Mr. Rao’s spirit will live on in the school he
                                        loved and nurtured and in all the pupils who have benefitted from his
                                        establishment and existence for the past decades.</p><br><br><br>
